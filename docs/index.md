# What is NECN?

The Net Ecosystem Carbon & Nitrogen (NECN) Succession extension implements succession with full accounting of above and below ground carbon and nitrogen. Aboveground biomass generally follows the behavior of previous Biomass Succession extensions with cohorts that have biomass (g m-2). In addition, below ground processing of Carbon and Nitrogen is simulated following the logic of the Century nutrient cycling model (v4.0). 

# Features

- [x] Estimate Net Ecosystem Exchange.
- [x] Estimate Actual and Potential Evapotranspiration, Climatic Water Deficit, and Available Soil Water.
- [x] Estimate smoke emissions from wildfires and prescribed fires.
- [x] Species parameters input as CSV delimited files.
- [x] Estimate Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Nitrogen, Nitrogen fluxes
